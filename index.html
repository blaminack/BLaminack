  <p>Hi! I am Barry Laminack and you have discovered my site. Thanks for chekcing it out. I do appreciate it.</p>
  <p>This is my first personal website. I never really felt the need before now. I have been working in software
  development for about 18 years. I started out just playing around with BASIC and had fun on my Tandy 1000 from
  Radio Shack.</p>

  <p>Yeah, those were the days. It was just a hobby and it was years later before friends and family had looked at 
  me with puzzled faces wondering why I was not persuing a career in computers before the light bulb finally went off.</p>
  <p>By that time I was on a Dell computer I had bought and upgraded several times for the latest and greatest games
  coming out. My all time favorite was Descent. Of course Doom, Duke Nukem, Wolfstien 3D, F15 Strike Eagle, and a few more.
  And I had become addicted to Visual Basic. I think I started with version 3 and progressed my way up to Visual Basic 6.</p>
  <p>After graduating with an associates degree in Computer Programming, I was actually able to get my foot in the door at
  a small company. One of the few among the many industrial plants hiring AS400 and COBOL programmers in the Chattanooga area
  at the time. I worked with them for about 2 years and took on a few six month contract jobs. I eventually ended up at 
  UnumProvident, later rebranded to Unum. After my 6 month contract was up, I was hired on full time. A few year later we 
  moved to the recently released Microsoft .Net using C#.
  </p>
  <p>After 15 years working on many projects and applications using C# .Net and SQL Server, I am now finding that I should have 
  ventured out and kept up with more technologies than just those my current job was using and cared about.
